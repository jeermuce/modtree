/// This program is a simple tree maintenance tool that creates and updates mod
/// files in a directory tree for a Rust project. It uses the newer style of mod
/// files, where mod files are named after their directory and exist in the parent directory.
///
/// This does not support:
/// - the older style of mod files, which are named `mod.rs` and exist in the directory they represent.
/// - modifying files that are not modules (e.g., `lib.rs`, `main.rs`).
/// - removing mod statements or files.
///
/// This partly supports:
/// - renaming files/directories (creates new mod entries but doesn't remove old ones).
/// - moving files/directories (creates new mod entries but doesn't remove old ones).
///
/// This fully supports:
/// - creating mod files for new Rust source files.
/// - handling nested directories (will ignore directories that contain no Rust source files).
/// - adding appropriate `mod` statements for new files in existing mod directories.
